* SQL script file to create a user for MySQL lessons

This script file should be run in Cloud9. It will create a user on the database that can then be used with the sample code.

To run it, use `wget` to download the raw file.

Then, import it into MySQL with the command: `sudo mysql < create_user.sql`

Change the code in the videos to use `c9user` as the username and `password` as the password.
