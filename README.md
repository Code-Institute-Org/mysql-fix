# SQL script file to create a user for MySQL lessons

This script file should be run in Cloud9. It will create a user on the database that can then be used with the sample code.

To run it, use the following command:

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-Institute-Org/mysql-fix/master/createuser.sh && source ./createuser.sh```

This will create a user in the database with the username of whatever the `C9_USER` environment variable is set to.
